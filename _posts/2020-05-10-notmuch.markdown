In a previous post, [I described how I was trying out aerc for
email](/2020/01/19/linux-mail.html) after moving back to a Linux-based
primary desktop machine. As a started tinkering with things and
subscribing to more email lists, a simple aerc-based setup wasn't
cutting it. I know aerc has notmuch support, but I wanted better
thread support and better emacs integration. 

When I first set up offlineimap, I was putting everything from each
email provider into a separate folder. The next step would be a
rule-based filing to put mailing list into separate folders. But
putting email into different folders would have been a band-aid. I
felt like I needed a full email tagging solution. Searching and
threading were must-have features. So it was time to try out
[notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org/).

The first step would be to set up emacs as an email client. That was
pretty straightforward (this hasn't really been tuned at all):

```lisp
(setq mail-host-address "mydomain")
(setq user-full-name "My Name")
(setq user-mail-address "mail@mydomain")

(setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
(setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)

(setq send-mail-function    'smtpmail-send-it
          smtpmail-smtp-server  "my.smtp.server"
          smtpmail-stream-type  'ssl
          smtpmail-smtp-service 465)
(defun my-message-mode-setup ()
       (setq fill-column 72)
       (turn-on-auto-fill))
(add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'my-message-mode-setup)
```

Then I set up the splash screen for notmuch (after package-install):

```lisp
(setq notmuch-saved-searches '(
    (:name "all"
    :query "*"
    :sort-order newest-first
    :key "a")

    (:name "inbox"
    :query "tag:inbox and not (tag:list)"
    :key "i")

    (:name "sent"
    :query "tag:from-me"
    :sort-order newest-first
    :key "s")

    (:name "btrfs"
    :query "tag:btrfs and tag:inbox")
    
    (:name "rss"
    :query "folder:rss and tag:inbox")

    (:name "github"
    :query "folder:github and tag:inbox")

    (:name "notmuch"
    :query "tag:notmuch and tag:inbox"
    :key "n")

    (:name "emacs-devel"
    :query "tag:emacs-devel and tag:inbox")

    (:name "friend"
    :query "tag:friend and tag:inbox"
    :sort-order newest-first)
))
```

Then I needed to have notmuch index my email. Create this script in `~/.config/notmuch/new.sh`:
```sh
#!/bin/sh

nm=/usr/bin/notmuch
$nm new 2>/dev/null
$nm tag --batch --input=/home/timmy/.config/notmuch/tags.txt
```

I created this `tags.txt` file:

```txt
+btrfs +list -- linux-btrfs@vger.kernel.org
+emacs-devel +list -- emacs-devel@gnu.org
+notmuch +list -- notmuch@notmuchmail.org
+aerc +list -- ~sircmpwn/aerc@lists.sr.ht
+list -- folder:rss
+list -- folder:github
+to-me -- to:myemailaddress
+from-me -- from:myemailaddress
+patch -- subject:PATCH
```

My `~/.config/notmuch/config` is pretty basic:

```ini
[database]
path=/home/timmy/mail
[user]
name=My Name
primary_email=timmy@email1
other_email=timmy@email2;timmy@email3;
[new]
tags=unread;inbox;
ignore=
[search]
exclude_tags=spam;
[maildir]
synchronize_flags=true
```

I created a user systemd user service to run notmuch on my maildir that was populated by
offlineimap:

`~/.config/systemd/user/notmuch.service`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Notmuch new
Documentation=man:notmuch(1)

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/home/timmy/.config/notmuch/new.sh
TimeoutStopSec=120

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

`~/.config/systemd/user/notmuch.timer`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Notmuch timer

[Timer]
OnBootSec=1m
OnUnitInactiveSec=5m

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```


Then run `systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user start
notmuch.timer && systemctl --user status notmuch.timer` to start the
notmuch indexer.


Then start notmuch in GNU/Emacs with `M-x notmuch`.

This isn't complete without talking about how I get RSS feeds mixed
into my email. Obviously, the end goal is to spend the whole day in
GNU/Emacs. Having to open up 20 tabs with your favorite websites or
blogs and refresh them occasionally is not ideal. The solution I chose
is to write a systemd job scrape rss feeds and inject them into your
maildir for notmuch to index. I couldn't find anything online that I
liked so I wrote a quick app in [Go](https://golang.org/) to do the
job:

[Source and install instructions for feed2maildir](https://www.github.com/timmydo/feed2maildir).

A simple `fetchrss.sh` might look like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

fm() {
~/bin/feed2maildir --feed $1 --maildir ~/mail/rss
}
gh() {
~/bin/feed2maildir --feed $1 --maildir ~/mail/github
}

fm "https://www.phoronix.com/rss.php"
fm "https://lwn.net/headlines/rss"
fm "https://timmydouglas.com/feed.xml"
fm "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss"
gh "https://github.com/microsoft/BPerf/commits/dev.atom"
gh "https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed/commits/master.atom"
```

The only major gap I have right now is that my notmuch database isn't
replicated to other machines. I haven't had the need to solve that
problem yet, but when I do, I'll write another blog entry on it.
