One of my new year's resolutions was to not have a single tech company
be a single point of failure in my technical life. There have been a
bunch of
[attempts](https://gizmodo.com/i-cut-the-big-five-tech-giants-from-my-life-it-was-hel-1831304194)
to cut them out completely, but this is isn't about cutting them out
completely.

When I look at the things I rely on, Google Photos is one that started
out so convenient ("turn on photo backup?"), so well-done ("look at
this video we made showing memories from the first three months with
your newborn"), that it was easy to lose discipline and let it manage
everything. Eventually I had years of photos stored there that I
didn't have anywhere else. Part of the problem is that cell phones
make it so easy to take a bunch of pictures--it's too much work to go
through and organize them when Google Photos can do it for you. Then
you can just search for "Venice" or "Porsche," and it can find what
you want better than if you tried tagging everything yourself. Does an
adult with two young kids have time to set up OCR to extract text from
document pics, setup tensorflow to tag people and objects, borg backup
to some offsite location, etc.? Nope.

I get worried when I read those stories online about people having
their google accounts suspended for no obvious reason and with no
recourse. That wouldn't be a sad way to lose your photos and
videos. I had previously used OneDrive for photos and videos, but I
hit the 100 GB storage limit and was morally opposed to buying an
office subscription to get it to 1TB. Just let me buy storage a la
carte!


Anyways, the first part of photo storage independence would be
downloading all the photos to local storage on my
computer. Theoretically, I have enough space on one or two of my 1TB
SSDs, but it would have been really tight and I wanted to consolidate
everything to one place. (I was also looking for a project). So I
decided to buy two 8TB WD RED NAS drives, which I would plug into this
computer. I'm planning to set them up in a software RAID1
configuration for a little more durability.

So, I didn't see any easy way to download photos from Google Photos. I
saw a tool online that you could authorize to use APIs to do it, but I
was a little worried about downloading a lot through that tool in case
it flagged my account. There is a built-in Google Takeout tool that lets you
download all your history, so I tried that. I chose to have links to
zip files emailed to me and to split the zip files every 2 GB. I had
like 60-70GB of photos/videos, so I was expecting like 30-40 links.


The next day, I got an email with about 185 links of 2GB files. I
downloaded about 10 of them and then gave up. I'm not sure how the
metadata or whatever was going on could take up that much extra
space. I looked in one of the files and it had a bunch of JSON files
and the files were from different years, so it didn't seem like there
was an easy way to select what you want.

Exchanging money for convenience, I upped my Google One account
storage limit from 100GB to 2TB and then re-exported to Google
Drive. That was easier, then I just needed to get the Google Drive
sync tool to download the ten-or-so 50GB files. I probably could have
just selected 50GB links with the email option in retrospect. The
Google Drive sync tool doesn't know how to resume failed downloads or
pause/restart, and the bandwidth download cap feature doesn't work. So
it was really painful watching that try to download everything, and
thankfully my ISP has suspended data caps during COVID. OneDrive was
comparatively much easier, but it was syncing smaller files
(individual images/videos) so it's not an equal comparison.


I ordered my two 8TB WD RED NAS drives from Amazon in "frustration
free" packaging without thinking twice about it, but in hindsight,
that should have been a red flag. Here is how they arrived:

If you can't see it, there are holes poked in the anti-static
bags--probably from the drives hitting each other or other
things... Anyways, I decided to return those without opening them and
re-ordered through Newegg. Hopefully those will turn out better. I'll
continue the story in part 2.
