In a previous post, [I set up DNS over
TLS](/2019/06/09/dns-over-tls.html) with unbound on my Ubiquiti
EdgeRouter Lite. I can't remember what exactly happened, but at some
point I updated the router software and the Linux distro didn't have a
package for unbound anymore. So I moved DNS to another computer
running CoreDNS.

If you are using IPv6, you may need to be careful that your IPv6
configuration settings don't pick up your ISP's DNS server. I won't go
into details here, but for me that meant running a command like `set
interfaces ethernet eth2 dhcpv6-pd pd 0 interface eth1 no-dns`.

Anyways, the first step is installing CoreDNS. It wasn't packaged for my
Linux distro, so I just [downloaded the latest release off
github](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases), and unzipped the
binary to my /usr/bin (or /usr/local/bin) folder. The [deployment
repository](https://github.com/coredns/deployment/tree/master/systemd)
has some scripts you can use to set it up with systemd.

I also ran a `useradd coredns -d /var/lib/coredns` set up a
`/etc/coredns/Corefile` (feel free to remove the IPv6 forward):

```text
. {
  bind 10.18.11.2
  prometheus
  log
  errors
  cache
  forward . tls://9.9.9.9 tls://[2620:fe::fe]:853 {
    tls_servername dns.quad9.net
    health_check 15s
  }

  hosts {
    10.18.11.2 timmy
    10.18.11.2 timmy.home
    fallthrough
  }
}
```

I can monitor all coredns logs/dns requests through `journalctl -f -u
coredns`. I also added a job to `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yaml` to
scrape:

```yaml
  - job_name: coredns
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9153']
```

then `systemctl reload prometheus`.
