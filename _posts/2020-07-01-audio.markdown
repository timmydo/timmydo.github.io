I was looking for a new mini-hobby, and found an idea staring me in
the face: my [audio-technica ATR-2100 USB microphone](https://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/b8dd84773f83092c/index.html). I've been using
it as a mic for work and gaming, but I felt like I wasn't really
getting the most out of it through its USB connection, which I also
used to run my headphones, a budget-level Sennheiser HD 419. It was
time to upgrade.

I quickly decided on the [Massdrop Sennheiser
HD6XX](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-sennheiser-hd6xx), which has
received good reviews and lists for around $220. When you get a nice
pair of headphones, apparently it's not enough to plug them directly
into your computer, you want an external soundcard called a
[DAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter). Then
you don't just plug it into that directly, you get a [pre-amp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamplifier) designed
for headphones.


For the DAC and headphone pre-amp, I decided on a [Schiit
Modi](https://www.schiit.com/products/modi-1) and the [Schiit Magni
3+](https://www.schiit.com/products/magni-1). I think the good thing
about these is the Modi should work with any software, and the Magni
doesn't have any software dependency so I should be able to take it
with me. They're fairly modular so I could upgrade the pieces
individually.


Back to the mic--I wanted to try out the XLR connection, but my
motherboard doesn't have an XLR connection obviously. This type of mic
needs [phantom power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_power) to
work. The XLR cable will send a [balanced mono output
signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_audio) to a [Focusrite
scarlett
2i2](https://focusrite.com/en/usb-audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-2i2)
I purchased. I
think this is probably overkill for gaming/office VoIP stuff, but I
may dabble with other things at a later date (digital piano, etc.) and
I wanted to keep my options open. I
think I've made the mistake too many times of buying something
entry-level and then having to upgrade, so I decided
to start mid-level here.


Then I decided I wanted to setup a place for karaoke. I had connected a
newly built gaming computer to a TV downstairs for VR, but there was only a
simple HDMI connection there for regular TV tasks. I bought a [Yamaha
MG10XU](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/proaudio/mixers/mg_series_xu_model/index.html)
for connecting a couple of microphones (with XLR cables) and the line
out on my PC. The output from the mixer will feed into some [JBL
Studio 530](https://www.jbl.com) speakers I bought. They were on
sale--a pair for $300. The speakers will be powered by a "Kinter K2020A+
Limited Edition Original Tripath TA2020-020 Class-T Hi-Fi Audio Mini
Amplifier with 12V 5A Power Supply Black" that you can find online for
like $40. If the karaoke isn't a hit, I'll be able to use
everything somewhere else. Whereas if I just bought a karaoke box, I'd
have a big paper weight. I haven't got everything yet, but that's the
tentative plan.

While on this journey, I spent more time than I originally expected
trying to figure out all the new terms and connectors. (I think I
enjoy the learning and spending money part part of hobbies more than
the hobby itself...)  There are a bunch of different connector types:
XLR, RCA, 3.5mm, 6.35mm or 1/4" TRS or TS, speaker wire, etc. Within
those, you have terms like balanced vs unbalanced, power amp vs
pre-amp, RCA vs TRS vs TS, monitor vs speaker. I probably should have
spent more time on Wikipedia learning the concepts than searching for
terms on the internet:

  - [Interfaces/Connectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_and_video_interfaces_and_connectors)
  - [Phone connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio))
  - [RCA connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_connector)

Once I get everything, maybe I'll post a follow up if there are
learnings with talking about.
